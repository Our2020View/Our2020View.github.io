Here is a list of some of the quick and easy ones we have done:

  <h3>Coat Rack</h3>

This was a great idea I found on another [View Website](http://www.thoseyoungguys.com/2019/03/11/our-winnebago-view-24d-upgrades-and-modifications/).
  I seleted a coat rack that kinda matched the interior, and gave us lots of space to hang up those things that always seem to be needed by the door.  I removed the ladder holders, as we don't carry around the ladder, and secured the coat rack to the solid structure behind the plastic trim on the bed bottom.  It looks good and works very well:

 <h3>Drink Holders</h3>

 When sitting at the dinette table, either eating or playing games, I always seemed to be looking for somewhere to put my beverage.  I added two drink holders on either side of the dinette window - both were fastened with the scews that came with the holders, and are secured firmly to the face panel that makes up the surface of the interior wall.  The only placement consideration was to ensure that the blinds operated without impacting the functionality of the holder.

Here is a link to the [Camco Drink Holders](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000EDQR4G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that we installed.

<h3>Closet Drawers</h3>

We don't have the requirement to hang clothes, except for the coats at the front door.  I installed some shelves in the cloak closet that enabled us to haul clothes in and out of the house and stow them easily in the View.  I had a couple of storage totes in the basement, so modified the lids to make the shelves - now we load up the bins in the house and just drop them on the shelves when it is time to hit the road.

<h3>Compact DVD Player</h3>

Our previous motorhomes had a DVD, and to be honest - we did not use it very often.  The exception was watching our "Fireplace DVD" on the TV when temperatures turned cool.  We searched for a DVD player that was ultra compact, considering it was going to be dead weight for most of the year.  We found one at BestBuy that fit the bill:

[Sylvania SDVD1073 DVD Player](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sylvania-sdvd1073-progressive-scan-dvd-player/13014336)

To keep things simple, I dropped it in vertically to the right of the paper towel holder, and locked it in place with some package cushioning.  It has been working great:

<h3>Truma Water Hammer Fix</h3>

Shortly after we got our View, we developed a very annoying "racket" associated with the water pump opertion.  I don't know exactly when it started, or why it started, but at first I thought it was the pump making the noise.  In the 24J, the water pump is tucked up under the bed, near the back wall.  I went in there to have a look, but discovered that while the bed was up I could trace the hammering to the Truma water heater.  (With the bed down, it was not initially apparent where the source of the problem really was.)  I tried my best to adjust the pressure switch on the pump to play with the cold water delivery pressure, but the best I could do was make the hammering intermittant.  I reached out to Truma for some help - and they advised me that they have seen this before - and they had a fix!  They told me that the water pressure was too HIGH, and I needed to install a pressure regulator just before the inlet to the water heater.  Yes... they did indeed sell one that would cure the problem - and they would ship one to me right away.  (This part is not available in their online store - you have to give them a call)

The regulator, when combined with the PEX fittings you need, is about six inches long - too long to fit comfortably just before the cold water inlet to the heater in our 24J.  (I wanted to make sure that I installed it where it would only affect the water heater, and non of the other cold water taps.)  To compensate for the short PEX run available in this location, I compensated by adding an extension just downstream of the Winterization Valve # 1, using some RV 1/2" braided nylon flixible hose and looping it back into the inlet for the water heater.  Doeing it this way saved me re-designing the cold water run in that area of the RV.

This photo shows the extension I added to the run between the Winterization Valve # 1 and the inlet to the water heater:

This shot is a close up of the connections at each end of the extension loop:

After installation, the Truma water hammer was gone and the pump can be heard to be very quiet.
