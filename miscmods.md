Here are some mods that did not qualify for their own page:

  <h3>Coat Rack</h3>

This was a great idea I found on [Another View Website](http://www.thoseyoungguys.com/2019/03/11/our-winnebago-view-24d-upgrades-and-modifications/).
I selected a coat rack that kinda matched the interior, and gave us lots of space to hang up those things that always seem to be needed by the door.  I removed the ladder holders, as we don't carry around the ladder, and secured the coat rack to the solid structure behind the plastic trim on the bed bottom.  It looks good and works very well:

 <h3>Drink  / Phone Holders</h3>

 When sitting at the dinette table, either eating or playing games, I always seemed to be looking for somewhere to put my beverage.  I added two drink holders on either side of the dinette window - both were fastened with the scews that came with the holders, and are secured firmly to the face panel that makes up the surface of the interior wall.  The only placement consideration was to ensure that the blinds operated without impacting the functionality of the holder.  These also make handy spots to place a phone, too.

Here is a link to the [Camco Drink Holders](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000EDQR4G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that we installed.

<h3>Closet Drawers</h3>

We don't have the requirement to hang clothes, except for the coats at the front door.  I installed some shelves in the cloak closet that enabled us to haul clothes in and out of the house and stow them easily in the View.  I had a couple of storage totes in the basement, so modified the lids to make the shelves - now we load up the bins in the house and just drop them on the shelves when it is time to hit the road.

<h3>Compact DVD Player</h3>

Our previous motorhomes had a DVD, and to be honest - we did not use it very often.  The exception was watching our "Fireplace DVD" on the TV when temperatures turned cool.  We searched for a DVD player that was ultra compact, considering it was going to be dead weight for most of the year.  We found one online that fit the bill:

[Sylvania SDVD1073 DVD Player](https://curtis-sylvania.com/product/sdvd1073-fd-pl)

To keep things simple, I dropped it in vertically to the left of the paper towel holder, and locked it in place with some package cushioning.  It has been working great:

<h3>Truma Water Hammer Fix</h3>

Shortly after we got our View, we developed a very annoying "racket" associated with the water pump operation.  I don't know exactly when it started, or why it started, but at first I thought it was the pump making the noise.  In the 24J, the water pump is tucked up under the bed, near the back wall.  I went in there to have a look, but discovered that while the bed was up I could trace the hammering to the Truma water heater.  (With the bed down, it was not initially apparent where the source of the problem really was.)  I tried my best to adjust the pressure switch on the pump to play with the cold water delivery pressure, but the best I could do was make the hammering intermittant.  I reached out to Truma for some help - and they advised me that they had seen this before - and they had a fix!  They told me that the water pressure was too HIGH, and I needed to install a pressure regulator just before the inlet to the water heater.  Yes... they did indeed sell one that would cure the problem - and they would ship one to me right away.  (This part is not available in their online store - you have to give them a call.)

The regulator, when combined with the PEX fittings you need, is about six inches long - too long to fit comfortably just before the cold water inlet to the heater in our 24J.  (I wanted to make sure that I installed it where it would only affect the water heater, and none of the other cold water users.)  To compensate for the short PEX run available in this location, I added an extension just downstream of the Winterization Valve # 1, using some RV 1/2" braided nylon flexible hose and looping it back into the inlet for the water heater.  Doing it this way saved me re-designing the cold water run in that area of the RV.

This photo shows the extension I added to the run between the Winterization Valve # 1 and the inlet to the water heater, with the Truma pressure regulator at the end of the loop:

This shot is a close up of the connections at each end of the extension loop:

After installation, the Truma water hammer was gone and the pump can be heard to be running very quietly.

<h3>More Locker Space</h3>

We had an annoying vibration going on while driving, that seemed to be comming from the driver's side exterior.  I traced it to a sheet metal false wall that was not secured correctly in the centre locker, and while getting ready to secure it so it did not rattle - I decided to look and see what it was actually protecting.  It turns out it was only there to protect a small run of electrical cable, so I secured the cables out of the way and did away with the false wall.  The entire locker is now available to us for storage.  The photo shows the screw line where the wall was secured to the floor, and the zip tie I used to keep the cables out of the way:

<h3>"Bonus" Electrical Outlet</h3>

This mod was done in conjuction with the dedicated 20 amp circuit we installed to allow us to run an electric heater independent of the coach's 30 amp electrical system.  See that one here:

[Dedicated 20 Amp Circuit](/ourmods/20ampcircuit/)

We only used one of the plugs in the receptacle for that dedicated circuit, so by making this a split circuit - by removing the hot terminals connecting tab - we had a free receptacle that we decided to hook up to the coach's 30 amp electrical system.  As explained in the "Dedicated 20 Amp Circuit" description, we elected to feed this new receptacle from the circuit that powers the induction cooktop.  The induction cooktop is powered from a 20 amp receptacle under the right hand sink.  

Winnebago has used a slimline RV receptacle for the cooktop plug, and to be honest, I didn't see how it was going to be possible to get in there to add extra wiring to feed the new plug.  Instead, I chose to sever the feed to the cooktop plug, install a junction box under the counterop, and wire in the new 12/2 cable inbetween the feed and the old plug.  So, feed line IN to the junction box, and old 12/2 cable OUT to the induction cooktop plug along with new 12/2 cable OUT to the new plug.

Here is a shot of the junction box mounted to the wall, with the feed line to the induction cooktop ready to be severed (To mount the junction box to the wall, I started with mounting it to a piece of painted 1/2" plywood, and then used two part structural expoxy to glue the plywood to the wall):

<img src="/assets/web20Amp6.jpg"/>

With the feed line entering the junction box from the bottom, the two lines going to the cooktop plug and the new plug come out the top:

<img src="/assets/web20Amp8.jpg"/>

I ran the new circuit along the underside of the countertop:

<img src="/assets/web20Amp12.jpg"/>

And then ran it into the new receptacle where it was hooked up to the botom plug:

<img src="/assets/web20Amp15.jpg"/>

As explained in the "Dedicated 20 Amp Circuit" description, the location for the new receptacle was partially chosen for its convenient proximity to the lithium battery heater and cab seating:

The top "yellow" plug is for the glorified extension chord of the "Dedicated 20 Amp Circuit", and the bottom "green" bonus plug is hooked up to the coach's 30 amp electrical system.

<h3>Easy Thermal Blanket</h3>

On the web you will find many examples of thermal blankets that RVers have fabricated to keep the temperature differential between the cab and the coach as large as possible.  We came up witht the idea to zip two sleeping bags together to form one large blanket that fit the dimensions of the cab / coach division perfectly.  With a bit of overlap on the top bunk held in place by whatever we were storing up there, the thermal blanket really worked well during both summer and winter.  We used a couple of old summer sleeping bags we had surplus in the basement, but even with that lightweight protection, we observed the difference in coach and cab temperatures to be really significant.

<h3>Larger Dining Table</h3>

We found the dining table that came with the View a bit too small.  We wanted it a little wider for times when it is being used for a games table, and the length longer to allow for a more relaxed seating position.  I found a table top from IKEA that made for a pretty simple swap out, with only a little bit of effort.  It is four inches longer, and 3 and a quarter inches wider:

[IKEA Linnmon Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/linnmon-tabletop-white-00251135/)

The aesthetics work out, as the colour is pretty close to the white tables used during the 2020 model year.  It matches the coach’s interior well, but there are a few functional notes... because the table is 3 and a quarter inches wider, the side bench top does not open fully without having to compress the seat's cushion.  Also, because I had to make a platform for the table base to attach too – the table sits about 3/4" higher than the Winnebago table.  The last one concerns the original Winnebago table’s use as a piece of the bed support when the dinette is used for sleeping.  With the new dimensions of the table, it cannot do that double duty any longer.  If we really want to use the dinette for sleeping, we’ll have to carry the old table or make a lighter weight substitute support piece to do the job.  Probably cutting a piece of ½” plywood is what I will do for those very odd occasions when we have four on board.

Here is a comparison of the size – The difference is not huge, but enough to make the table more comfortable in all ways.  This shot shows the old table sitting on top of the new table:

<img src="/assets/webtable2.jpg"/>

Because the table is hollow with not a lot for the base mounting screws to grab onto, I elected to make a ¾” plywood base plate to make the mounting sturdier.  This base plate is 8” x 8”, and was attached using wood glue.  It is a solid grip.  The thin particle board backing tended to be a bit concave, giving the base plate some trouble with a good seal -  so I had to put about 20 pounds on the plate to ensure that all of the glue found table backing to adhere to.

<img src="/assets/webtable4.jpg"/>

Once the backing plate was secure, swapping out the table attachment was easy:

I'm likely biased, but I think it looks great...

<h3>Privacy Curtain</h3>

The View J model is a really great floorplan, but it does have its limitations when it comes down to trying to find somewhere to change with a little bit of privacy.  Grandpa Ron had the same issue, and solved the problem by putting up a privacy curtain.  Here is his simple fix, which we copied:

[Grandpa Ron's Privacy Curtain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNSykmJNWes)

We used a shower curtain that matched the Winnebago decor, and bought a shower tension bar that was long enough for the width of the coach.  (The tension bar spans the width of the coach, independent of the postion of the slide.)  As Grandpa Ron demonstrated, it was an easy install after that.

The curtain works great with the slide in...

Or with the slide out...

The tension bar's grip points are shown in these next two photos:

Nothing more to reveal about this mod...
