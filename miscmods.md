Here is a list of some of the quick and easy ones we have done:

  <h3>Coat Rack</h3>

This was a great idea I found on another [View Website](http://www.thoseyoungguys.com/2019/03/11/our-winnebago-view-24d-upgrades-and-modifications/).
I selected a coat rack that kinda matched the interior, and gave us lots of space to hang up those things that always seem to be needed by the door.  I removed the ladder holders, as we don't carry around the ladder, and secured the coat rack to the solid structure behind the plastic trim on the bed bottom.  It looks good and works very well:

 <h3>Drink  / Phone Holders</h3>

 When sitting at the dinette table, either eating or playing games, I always seemed to be looking for somewhere to put my beverage.  I added two drink holders on either side of the dinette window - both were fastened with the scews that came with the holders, and are secured firmly to the face panel that makes up the surface of the interior wall.  The only placement consideration was to ensure that the blinds operated without impacting the functionality of the holder.  These also make handy spots to place a phone, too.

<h3>Closet Drawers</h3>

We don't have the requirement to hang clothes, except for the coats at the front door.  I installed some shelves in the cloak closet that enabled us to haul clothes in and out of the house and stow them easily in the View.  I had a couple of storage totes in the basement, so modified the lids to make the shelves - now we load up the bins in the house and just drop them on the shelves when it is time to hit the road.

<h3>Compact DVD Player</h3>

Our previous motorhomes had a DVD, and to be honest - we did not use it very often.  The exception was watching our "Fireplace DVD" on the TV when temperatures turned cool.  We searched for a DVD player that was ultra compact, considering it was going to be dead weight for most of the year.  We found one at BestBuy that fit the bill:

[Sylvania SDVD1073 DVD Player](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sylvania-sdvd1073-progressive-scan-dvd-player/13014336)

To keep things simple, I dropped it in vertically to the right of the paper towel holder, and locked it in place with some package cushioning.  It has been working great:

<h3>Truma Water Hammer Fix</h3>

Shortly after we got our View, we developed a very annoying "racket" associated with the water pump operation.  I don't know exactly when it started, or why it started, but at first I thought it was the pump making the noise.  In the 24J, the water pump is tucked up under the bed, near the back wall.  I went in there to have a look, but discovered that while the bed was up I could trace the hammering to the Truma water heater.  (With the bed down, it was not initially apparent where the source of the problem really was.)  I tried my best to adjust the pressure switch on the pump to play with the cold water delivery pressure, but the best I could do was make the hammering intermittant.  I reached out to Truma for some help - and they advised me that they had seen this before - and they had a fix!  They told me that the water pressure was too HIGH, and I needed to install a pressure regulator just before the inlet to the water heater.  Yes... they did indeed sell one that would cure the problem - and they would ship one to me right away.  (This part is not available in their online store - you have to give them a call.)

The regulator, when combined with the PEX fittings you need, is about six inches long - too long to fit comfortably just before the cold water inlet to the heater in our 24J.  (I wanted to make sure that I installed it where it would only affect the water heater, and none of the other cold water users.)  To compensate for the short PEX run available in this location, I added an extension just downstream of the Winterization Valve # 1, using some RV 1/2" braided nylon flexible hose and looping it back into the inlet for the water heater.  Doing it this way saved me re-designing the cold water run in that area of the RV.

This photo shows the extension I added to the run between the Winterization Valve # 1 and the inlet to the water heater, with the Truma pressure regulator at the end of the loop:

After installation, the Truma water hammer was gone and the pump can be heard to be running very quietly.

<h3>More Locker Space</h3>

We had an annoying vibration going on while driving, that seemed to be comming from the driver's side exterior.  I traced it to a sheet metal false wall that was not secured correctly in the centre locker, and while getting ready to secure it so it did not rattle I decided to look and see what it was protecting.  It turns out it was only there to protect a small run of electrical cable, so I secured the cables out of the way and did away with the false wall.  The entire locker is now available to us for storage.  The photo shows the screw line where the wall was secured to the floor, and the zip tie I used to keep the cables out of the way:

<h3>Spare Tire "Clank" and "Thump"</h3>

On the topic of annoying noises, whenever going over a bump we'd get a "clank" followed by a "thump".  Also, when jumping off the ladder when coming down from the roof, I'd get the same results.  It turns out the spare tire cradle and tire are not secured very well - The cradle is held securely to the threaded rods, but because the threaded rods have not been positioned correctly on their support posts, the cradle is not compressing the tire against the roof brace stubs as I assume it was intended.  The result is the cradle rattles around and the tire is free to jump when going over a bump.  On our View there is only about 1/4" of thread on the rods to play with, but it was enough to be able to lower the cradle a bit and jam in a piece of 2" closed cell foam to take up the space between the tire sidewall and the brace stubs.  When the cradle was raised a bit using the threads left over on the rods, it was enough to firmly hold the cradle and tire in place.  The first photo shows an example of a threaded rod as I found it - the threaded rod is suspended too low on the support post to hold the tire up against the brace stubs.  The second photo shows one of the 2" closed cell foam pieces I inserted to take up the space and compress the tire in place, on both halves of the tire.  All quiet now.

As a side note, the plastic twist nuts that were supposed to allow you to undo the cradle and lower the tire to the ground were seized on the threaded rods.  I was able to get one of the twist nuts off, but the other stripped on the inside locknut.  Luckily, because of all of the play in the cradle, it was relatively easy to remove the threaded rods from their support posts.  I removed the plastic twist caps from the locknuts, and threw them alway.  Before I put the locknuts back on after I had inserted my foam pieces, I brushed on some anti-seize compound onto the threaded rods to allow for nut removal in a time of need.  It would not make any sense at all to not be able to access your spare tire when required, so I recommend you check the nuts on your tire cradle too.
