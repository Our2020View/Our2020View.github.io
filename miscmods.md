Here is a list of some of the quick and easy ones we have done:

  <h3>Coat Rack</h3>

This was a great idea I found on another [View Website](http://www.thoseyoungguys.com/2019/03/11/our-winnebago-view-24d-upgrades-and-modifications/).
  I seleted a coat rack that kinda matched the interior, and gave us lots of space to hang up those things that always seem to be needed by the door.  I removed the ladder holders, as we don't carry around the ladder, and secured the coat rack to the solid structure behind the plastic trim on the bed bottom.  It looks good and works very well:

 <h3>Drink Holders</h3>

 When sitting at the dinette table, either eating or playing games, I always seemed to be looking for somewhere to put my beverage.  I added two drink holders on either side of the dinette window - both were fastened with the scews that came with the holders, and are secured firmly to the face panel that makes up the surface of the interior wall.  The only placement consideration was to ensure that the blinds operated without impacting the functionality of the holder.

Here is a link to the [Camco Drink Holders](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000EDQR4G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that we installed.

<h3>Closet Drawers</h3>

We don't have the requirement to hang clothes, except for the coats at the front door.  I installed some shelves in the cloak closet that enabled us to haul clothes in and out of the house and stow them easily in the View.  I had a couple of storage totes in the basement, so modified the lids to make the shelves, and now we load up the bins in the house and just load them on the shelves when it is time to hit the road.
