Here is a list of some of the quick and easy ones we have done:

  <h3>Coat Rack</h3>

This was a great idea I found on another [View Website](http://www.thoseyoungguys.com/2019/03/11/our-winnebago-view-24d-upgrades-and-modifications/)
I seleted a coat rack that kinda matched the interior, and gave us lots of space to hang up those things that always seem need to be hung up by the door.  I removed the ladder holders, as we don't carry around the ladder, and secured the coat rack to the solid structure behind the plastic trim on the bed bottom.  It looks good and works very well:
