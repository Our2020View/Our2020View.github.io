So, what is with a weight reduction program on a brand new motor home?  Well, one of the common misconceptions out there is that these Mercedes Sprinter based Class C motor homes have an excess of load carrying capacity.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  

Regardless of what a sales person will tell you, these Sprinter based Class Cs are not all that capable as soon as you add a passenger or two.  In fact, even with just the two of you up front, your load capacity very quickly drops to zero as soon as you put on water and “load’r up” with what you thought were the essentials.  Unlike a Class B, which very quickly runs out of space to store things long before you get close to being overweight, a Sprinter based Class C runs out of weight capability long before you have got it filled up.  

Using our View 24J as an example with weight measured in pounds, here is what I mean:

This is the absolute maximum weight that the Sprinter (our View) is allowed to weigh in at, EVER                                                                                                  |

Keep in mind you don't have any gear, groceries, or clothing on board yet.  (What does your tool box weigh?  A case of beer?) |

Two hundred and thirty three pounds?  Yes, I’m serious.  This is one of the reasons some Sprinter based Class C manufacturers don’t put any passenger seat belts on board.  As soon as you add passengers the numbers get pretty dismal, don't they?  If we go out to another part of the continent to meet up with our kids, we each get to take a backpack and a brown bag lunch.  No fun.

We’ve had some salespeople actually tell us that the View has over 4000 pounds of cargo carrying capacity.  In doing so, they were hoping that we didn’t know the difference between the Gross Combination Weight Rating and the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating.  That second rating, the GVWR, is that maximum Sprinter number up above – 11030 pounds.  That first rating, the GCWR, is that maximum weight of the Sprinter (11030 pounds) and the weight of something you are towing behind.  Your maximum loaded Sprinter and whatever you are towing behind cannot go over the GCWR.  For our 24J, that number is about 15,250 pounds.  But, you still can’t go over 11030 pounds on the View portion of that combination.  Again, the GCWR is a very big number, but is starts with a maximum weight of the View itself of 11030 pounds.

So, back to a weight reduction program.  Is there anything on the View that we don’t need, something that we would be carrying around with no use?  It turns out that there might be:

1.	Lead Acid Coach Batteries – Replace them with Lithium and save about 90 lbs?
2.	Remove the rear stabilizers – We can’t see ever using these
3.	Remove the two TVs? – Well, maybe one TV.  We’ll see...
4.	Remove the ladder to the front bunk?
5.	Remove the Sprinter cab booster seats? – Not required
6.	How about those Ottomans? – They look good, but will we use them?
7.	Remove the Onan Genset?  Do we dare?  That would save 172 pounds!

Here is what we ended up doing to save some weight:
