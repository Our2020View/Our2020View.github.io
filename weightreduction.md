So, what is with a weight reduction program on a brand new motor home?  Well, one of the common misconceptions out there is that these Mercedes Sprinter based Class C motor homes have an excess of load carrying capacity.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  
Regardless of what a sales person will tell you, these Sprinter based Class Cs are not all that capable as soon as you add a passenger or two.  In fact, even with just the two of you up front, your load capacity very quickly drops to zero as soon as you put on water and “load’r up” with what you thought were the essentials.  Unlike a Class B, which very quickly runs out of space to store things long before you get close to being overweight, a Sprinter based Class C runs out of weight capability long before you have got it filled up.  
Using our View 24J as an example with weight measured in pounds, here is what I mean:
