title: Roof Solar Off Switch

Our View did not come with a method to easily isolate the rooftop solar panels from the coach.  During the times when I wanted to ensure the solar was not attempting to push 10 amps of current into the batteries – puttering around in the battery box, attempting to quantify the amount of load a system was pulling, or closing up the coach for the winter – I had to resort to climbing up onto the roof and pulling the plugs on the two panels.  Ok, not a big deal when the roof is dry, but a whole different story when the roof is ice or frost covered!  Earlier this winter, as I was sliding back to the rear of the motorhome with no control of my trajectory and potential impending doom, I started thinking ... “there must be a better way!”

I have decided that “better way” is to install an in-coach switch.  Later in the spring I will break into the panel above the fridge, and install a red switch in the power line coming from the roof.  There isn’t a good looking place to install the switch beside the solar controller, so I will hide it under the bed near the Truma hot water heater.  

This is the switch I have chosen:

[I Litton battery disconnect switch](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B097JHCXD5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1)

The switch will only see about 15 amps maximum from our two 100 watt panels, but I will use #10 / 30 amp wire to match the controller and the original Winnebago installation.  In addition, the current rating on this switch is more than plenty for the loads that will be routinely seen.

I’ll let you know how this goes, when spring arrives.
