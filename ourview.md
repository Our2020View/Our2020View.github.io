Before we get into the modifications, maybe I should tell you why we opted for the View 24J, after several years of research?  In a nutshell, the new 2020 View had all of the system and coach features that we had been wanting in a not-so-big motor home with comfortable sleeping for four.  Here is the list of advantages for us:

1.	More room – Very comfortable sleeping for four +
2.	Microwave on battery power – new to 2020
3.	Induction cook top – No more burning fossil fuels to make pancakes
4.	Roof access port – Flexibility into the future – new to 2020
5.	Large shower – When compared to a Class B!
6.	Residential mattress – Full time setup
7.	Electric heat pump – Less use of a portable micro heater
8.	2000W inverter – Can handle a microwave now – new to 2020
9.	Tankless water heater – Not carrying around 60 lbs of water
10.	Tank sensors that work – Sensor on the outside of tanks, what a concept!
11.	Freshwater above the floor – No more frozen water lines in the spring and fall
12.	Heated holding tanks – Useful for those morning dumps in the spring and fall
13.	Black tank flush – Always wanted one of these!
14.	Dump valves that can be maintained – Ease of access and servicing
15.	Large holding tanks – Four times that of our Class Bs
16.	Enough storage that we don’t need to carry our Stow-a-Way2
17.	Can now carry bikes on the back
18.	Ease of access to the battery bay
19.	Easy Lithium upgrade – new to 2020
20.	Roof is easily accessible via ladder
21.	The Satellite radio antenna is on the roof – Full time signal reception!  Go Figure!
22.	The entire coach is accessible with the slide in- Perfect for being “on the go”
23.	The propane tank selector valve solenoid has been removed – No parasitic battery drain -  new to 2020

The Disadvantages for us:

1.	No macerator system – we fixed that ourselves
2.	Passenger seating - not as comfy as Captain’s chairs
3.	Only one table – we added our own for the cab seating area
4.	Higher fuel consumption – not too much higher, all things considered
5.	Unable to fit a dedicated chest freezer – we had a 65 quart chest freezer in our Class B

A pretty small list of disadvantages, when stacked up against the advantages.  

I hope you enjoy the material; it certainly has been fun making the changes to what was already a very capable motor home.
