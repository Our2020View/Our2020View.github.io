Before we get into the modifications, maybe I should tell you why we opted for the View 24J, after several years of research?  In a nutshell, the new 2020 View had all of the system and coach features that we had been wanting in a not-so-big motor home with comfortable sleeping for four.  Here is the list of noteworthy advantages to us when transitioning from our Class B:

1.	More room – very comfortable sleeping for four +
2.	Microwave on battery power – new for 2020
3.	Induction cook top – no more burning fossil fuels to make pancakes
4.	12 volt / compressor fridge - gets cold (and stays cold) very quickly - regardless of the slope on the site
5.	Roof access port – rooftop flexibility into the future – new for 2020
6.	Large shower – when compared to a Class B!
7.	Residential mattress – full time setup - ease of access
8.	Electric heat pump – less use of a portable micro heater
9.	Big 2000 watt inverter – now allows the microwave to run off of battery power – new for 2020
10.	Tankless water heater – no longer carrying around 60 lbs of water - new for 2020
11.	Tank sensors that work – sensors on the outside of tanks, what a concept!
12.	Freshwater above the floor – with a minor mod, no more frozen fresh water lines when it gets cold
13.	Heated holding tanks – useful for those morning departure dumps in the spring and fall
14.	Black tank flush – always wanted one of these!
15.	Dump valves that can be maintained – ease of access and servicing
16.	Large holding tanks – four times that of our Class Bs
17.	Enough storage that we don’t need to carry our Stow-a-Way2 hitch cargo carrier
18.	Can now carry bikes on the back
19.	Ease of access to the battery bay
20.	Easy Lithium upgrade – new for 2020
21.	Roof is easily accessible via ladder
22.	The Satellite radio antenna is on the roof – full time signal reception!  Go Figure!
23.	The entire coach is accessible with the slide in - perfect for being “on the go” or winter camping
24.	The propane solenoid shutoff valve has been removed – no parasitic battery drain -  new for 2020
25.	A fairly decent occupant and cargo carrying capacity (OCCC) - around 1300 lbs for us
26.	An OCCC that allowed Winnebago to include a spare tire
27.	An OCCC that gave Winnebago the capability to allow three passengers in the coach

The disadvantages for us:

1.	No macerator system – we fixed that ourselves
2.	Rear Passenger seating - not as comfy as Captain’s chairs
3.	Only one table – we added our own portable table for the cab seating area
4.	Higher fuel consumption – not too much higher, all things considered (We are averaging 15 mpg)
5.	Unable to fit a dedicated chest freezer – we had a 65 quart chest freezer in our Class B
6.	It has a slide - just something else to maintain  (But, it is handy with guests on board)

A pretty small list of disadvantages, when stacked up against the advantages.  

I hope you enjoy the material; it certainly has been fun making the changes to what was already a very capable motorhome.
