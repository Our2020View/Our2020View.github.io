Before we get into the modifications, maybe I should tell you why we opted for the View 24J, after several years of research?  In a nutshell, the new 2020 View had all of the system and coach features that we had been wanting in a not-so-big motor home with comfortable sleeping for four.  Here is the list of noteworthy advantages to us when transitioning from our Class B:

1.	More room – very comfortable sleeping for four +
2.	Microwave on battery power – new for 2020
3.	Induction cook top – no more burning fossil fuels to make pancakes
4.	Roof access port – rooftop flexibility into the future – new for 2020
5.	Large shower – when compared to a Class B!
6.	Residential mattress – full time setup - ease of access
7.	Electric heat pump – less use of a portable micro heater
8.	2000 Watt inverter – Large enough now to allow the microwave to run off of battery power – new for 2020
9.	Tankless water heater – no longer carrying around 60 lbs of water - new for 2020
10.	Tank sensors that work – sensors on the outside of tanks, what a concept!
11.	Freshwater above the floor – no more frozen fresh water lines in the spring and fall
12.	Heated holding tanks – useful for those morning departure dumps in the spring and fall
13.	Black tank flush – always wanted one of these!
14.	Dump valves that can be maintained – ease of access and servicing
15.	Large holding tanks – four times that of our Class Bs
16.	Enough storage that we don’t need to carry our Stow-a-Way2 hitch cargo carrier
17.	Can now carry bikes on the back
18.	Ease of access to the battery bay
19.	Easy Lithium upgrade – new for 2020
20.	Roof is easily accessible via ladder
21.	The Satellite radio antenna is on the roof – full time signal reception!  Go Figure!
22.	The entire coach is accessible with the slide in - perfect for being “on the go”
23.	The propane solenoid shutoff valve has been removed – no parasitic battery drain -  new for 2020

The Disadvantages for us:

1.	No macerator system – we fixed that ourselves
2.	Passenger seating - not as comfy as Captain’s chairs
3.	Only one table – we added our own for the cab seating area
4.	Higher fuel consumption – not too much higher, all things considered (We are averaging 15.5 mpg)
5.	Unable to fit a dedicated chest freezer – we had a 65 quart chest freezer in our Class B

A pretty small list of disadvantages, when stacked up against the advantages.  

I hope you enjoy the material; it certainly has been fun making the changes to what was already a very capable motor home.
