<h3>Spot GPS Transmitter / Messenger</h3>

<img src="/assets/webspot.jpg"/>

We consider this product an added measure of insurance.  This little GPS transmitter allows global connection with recipients of your choice, and connection to first responders in the event of an emergency when off the beaten path.  It does not rely on cell signals; instead it uses satellite communication.

After the acquisition cost, there is a yearly subscription fee to enable monitoring of your position, rudimentary communication, and signaling to emergency first responders.  We turn on the tracking feature of the device to allow family to keep an eye on Mom and Dad as they wander here and there across the continent.  Family, friends, or colleagues can either check in on the position map as you travel, or check the position emails that the device can send out at your prompting.  Serious adventurers use the Spot for its emergency contact capability, but luckily we have not had to use it for that purpose.  For many years it has sat on the dash of our motorhomes to give all involved peace of mind.
Our particular Spot product has been upgraded to this current version:
