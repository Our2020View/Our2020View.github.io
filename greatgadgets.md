<h3>Spot GPS Transmitter / Messenger</h3>

<img src="/assets/webspot.jpg"/>

We consider this product an added measure of insurance.  This little GPS transmitter allows global connection with recipients of your choice, and connection to first responders in the event of an emergency when off the beaten path.  It does not rely on cell signals; instead it uses satellite communication.

After the acquisition cost, there is a yearly subscription fee to enable monitoring of your position, rudimentary communication, and signaling to emergency first responders.  We turn on the tracking feature of the device to allow family to keep an eye on Mom and Dad as they wander here and there across the continent.  Family, friends, or colleagues can either check in on the position map as you travel, or check the position emails that the device can send out at your prompting.  Serious adventurers use the Spot for its emergency contact capability, but luckily we have not had to use it for that purpose.  For many years it has sat on the dash of our motorhomes to give all involved peace of mind.
Our particular Spot product has been upgraded to this current version:

<h3>WiFi Signal Booster</h3>

PepWave Surf On – The – Go

This compact travel router has been a communication staple in our motorhomes since it was first recommended to us many years ago.  Similarly to your router at home, it allows you to create a local area network using a wired internet signal – but here is where it really pays for itself in an RV – and also allows you to capture a weak wireless WiFi signal and boost it to useable signal strength.  Its capture range is really quite remarkable when looking for a weak campground or coffee shop WiFi signal.  We’ve seen this thing capture a signal from hundreds and hundreds of yards away, when no signal of any kind is displayed on our devices, and then provide a streaming quality signal for use in the motorhome.  If you have been in a campground where the check-in staff tell you that you will need to come to the office to get on the internet, give this type of device some consideration.  This router / WiFi booster, or one similar, can be a connectivity lifesaver.

I see that our particular travel router is no longer in production, but this old link might give you some ideas as to the type of device to research for you RV:
