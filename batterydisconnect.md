title: Winter Battery Disconnect

One of the reasons we installed LifePO4 coach batteries was to allow us to leave the batteries in the View all winter, unattended.  For all of the years that we have operated a motorhome, we have stayed put up here in Canada for the winter.  That will likely change someday, but for now, the coach sits unattended for 3 or 4 months in Canadian winter temperatures.  The routine when storing our previous motorhomes was to remove the lead acid coach batteries and keep them warm and fully charged in the basement.  The process of removing the batteries, storing them, and then re-installing them – usually in temperatures associated with late fall and early spring – was a workload.

With the Battle Born LifePO4 batteries, you don’t need to worry about them discharging and subsequently freezing during cold temperature storage.  The only trick is to ensure that the batteries are completely isolated from the coach electrical system, resulting in no parasitic drain and no charging attempts by the solar panels.  In theory, the coach battery disconnect switch should prevent the batteries from slowly discharging over the winter – and if the solar is disconnected on the roof – there should be nothing to tax the built-in battery management system to guard against cold temperature charging.  But, in reality, does the battery disconnect switch really isolate “everything” from the batteries?  Or, are there some systems that are hot-wired to allow operation even with the battery disconnect selected?  I don’t really know, and I have not been able to convince myself that I’d be able to find the answer definitively.  So, in the past, I have been pulling out some wrenches and disconnecting the cables from the batteries as I lock the door and leave the coach alone for the winter.  And then connecting all the cables again in the early spring, when it is time to get on the road.

But, all of that is a bit of a pain; especially since it never gets done when the temperatures are comfortable to be working in.  A simpler solution would be to just throw a disconnect switch that is guaranteed to do the job, with no second guessing.  That is where this battery disconnect switch from Amazon comes in:

Come spring time, the plan is to install this on the ground cable that comes off the battery bank, and then add another cable to continue on, as before, to the Victron BMV712 shunt.  (Hence my choice of a black switch)  Essentially, I will be interrupting the ground path for the battery circuit – ensuring that no stray electrons can leave the batteries over the winter.  (Bundling up the positive cables and adding a disconnect in that path would work too, but this is much simpler and has the added safety benefit that disconnecting the grounding cable provides.)  Keep in mind that I needed to get a switch that could handle the near 200 amps that routinely is pulled out of the batteries when using high load appliances via the inverter.  This switch can handle that current.

I’m thinking that the only challenge here will be to find a good spot to put the switch – things are getting a bit tight in the battery box...

I’ll report back when done with the installation.
