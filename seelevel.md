I don’t know about you, but we found trying to get a half decent idea of how much water was in the fresh tank a bit of a pain.  Once the factory “OnePlace” monitoring panel went below 2/3rds on the fresh tank, all bets were off as to how much was in there that could reliably be used for trip planning.  Was it just below 2/3rds?  Or just above 1/3rd?  The difference there is over 12 gallons – a significant amount when trying to figure out if you can make it to the next water supply, or have enough to take a shower before hitting the road.  And, once it went below 1/3rd ... just how low was it?

I used to resort to going under the bed, shuffling the stuff in storage out of the way of the access panel, getting a flashlight, and visually checking to see the status of the water level.  Yes, on our 24J model, the water level can be checked visually, but as I said earlier – a bit of a pain.

The actual level of the fresh water supply became more important when we found ourselves winter camping, and there was no readily available source of water to replenish the tank.  Once we were in “water conservation mode”, every bit of information on that water level became even more important.

I had been looking at Garnet Instrument’s SeeLevel II tank monitoring system for a while, and after a particularly intense bit of dry camping, decided to give the system a try.  We don’t have the requirement to have the same granularity on the Grey and Black tank’s contents (we dump when those tanks hit 2/3rds), so I ordered the basic system that would be compatible with the tall 37 gallon tank we have in our View 24J model.  The basic 709 system will work with 3 tanks if they are not tall, 2 tanks if one is tall and one is short, or one tall tank with a left-over sending unit you can keep as a spare.  The basic system is the 709 kit:

The company makes many different displays with all kinds of functionality, but all we were concerned with was getting one tank to give us good, useful information.  Our factory “OnePlace” monitoring was going to remain fully functional, so we did not need to replace any of its features.

The general idea for this installation was to make the SeeLevel II fully independent, with its own wiring harness and power supply.  The display was to be mounted above the fridge, beside some other controls and displays.

Note - The company advertises that you can re-use your RV tank’s current wire runs, but we wanted to keep our factory “OnePlace” panel working as delivered.  Looking back after the job was complete, that was for sure the right decision – tracing the wire runs all over the coach would have been a huge job and not worth the time.  It was much simpler to run new wires and keep the “OnePlace” panel as a back-up source of water quantity.

Here is a wiring diagram of the circuit:

The Installation

1 – Knowing that getting at the water tank in our View 24J requires quite a bit of gymnastics, I elected to come up with a way to easily access the area.  As you know, if you slide the mattress in the foot direction about two feet, you can get at the water pump area via an access panel built into the bed board.  And, as you know, if you remove the mattress completely you can see that the top portion of the bed board is hinged to allow access to the water tank.  Removing some screws in that top part of the bed board, and disconnecting the shock strut under the bed board, will allow the top of the bed board to be folded back.

But, neither of those access methods was suitable for this job, as I needed a more comfortable way to get at things for extended periods of time.  So, here is what I came up with:

-	Remove the headboard. (It is screwed on to the wall.  A while back I added a French Cleat to the headboard to allow easy removal for projects like these.)
-	Remove the mattress.
-	Disconnect the shock strut under the bed board.  (It is easiest to disconnect the attachment to the bed board itself, not the bottom of the strut where it attaches to structure.)
-	Unscrew the top of the bed board so the entire bed board becomes free.
-	Lift up the inside edge of the bed board and prop it up to allow quick, (and frequent), access.  I used the table leg as a support.

Here is how all of that preparation ended up:

2 – I turned the battery master off for all wiring operations.

3 – The easiest place to start the installation was up at the panel, so all wiring left the area and flowed to the tank.  I wanted to mount the monitor panel up beside the “OnePlace” panel, but in our 24J model the slide-out switch got in the way.  The slack on the slide-out switch wiring in our particular View was just long enough to re-locate it to the left, and allow the new panel to fit in-between it and the “OnePlace” monitor comfortably.

After determining where I wanted the switch and new panel to go, I used a reciprocating saw to make the quick cuts – in our View, there was nothing behind there that was of concern while cutting:

3 – As I had done before on other mods that required wiring in this area, I removed the control panel on the fridge and fished all the new wires from the back of the fridge box.  (When the freezer door is open, you can see the three screws that hold the fridge control panel to the fridge structure.)  As before, I found that using the back right corner was the best route to bring wires up from under the bed / Truma area to the top of the fridge:

Also, I found that removing the “OnePlace” monitor panel allowed me to get my hand in behind the face trim board to work more freely in the area on top of the fridge.

4 – After fishing up a red power wire for the fuse box run, a wire for the blue sender circuit, and a wire for the panel ground wire, I left the power wire by the fuse box and ran the other two back to the water tank area.  A fourth wire was run from the rear along side the other two wires back to the fuse box, to complete the ground circuit.  I chose this wiring configuration to allow for only one connection to the ground post in case of future troubleshooting considerations... stuff happens.

5 – As per the sender installation instructions, I only temporarily attached the sender strips to the tank using painters tape.  (I had really wanted to install the strips to the left of the retention strap, but chose not too because the side of the tank in that area behind the top of the bed was not flat – it had a pretty good bulge that would have prevented the sender strip from lying flat.)

Here is where I chose to install our sender strips:

6 – I bundled the two blue sender wires to the new sender wire coming from the display using a wire nut, and the two black sender ground wires to the new ground wire also coming from up above the fridge AND the new wire coming from the fuse box ground - also using a wire nut.  Since these connections were only for test purposes, the ease of their use made for simplicity.  The new sender wire and new ground wire were connected to the blue and black wires of the display pigtail using butt connectors.  The green propane wire was left loose.

7 - I hooked up the power wire to the SeeLevel display using a butt connector on the red wire, and connected it to the fuse box, using a 3 amp fuse.  With all of the wiring hooked up suitably for a test, I put water in the fresh tank to a level that would test the top sender strip as well, and turned on the battery master switch.  The SeeLevel II display correctly indicated the amount of water that was in the tank.  I drained the tank and watched the quantity change correctly as the tank emptied.

8 – With a good test completed, I again turned off the battery master and disconnected all of the rear wiring.   After careful consideration of how I was going to get the gaps correct during the sender strip installation, I cleaned the tank area using a 50/50 water alcohol mix, peeled the backing off of the adhesive, and stuck the sender strips to the tank using the technique described in the installation manual.  

9 – I organized the wiring to keep things tidy, used butt connectors to make the connections, added some wire loom to the protect the wire runs, and then added a piece of polyethylene sheet to protect the strips from any of my future visits to the area.

Here is how the sender strips ended up looking:

10 – With the circuit working as designed, I finished up by re-installing the slide-out switch and securing the SeeLevel display to the trim panel above the fride.

Working as advertised.
