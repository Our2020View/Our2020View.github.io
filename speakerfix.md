title: Better Sprinter Sound Quality

We were quite shocked at how poor the sound system quality was in the 2020 Sprinter cab.  It was quite perplexing to think that the audio quality that came out of the factory was found to be satsisfactory by Mercedes Benz.   Looking around on the web I found a "hack" that was reported to work well and reported to be easy to do.  The fix was directed at the centre speaker, and essentially involved disabling its functionality.  Before I got into this, I searched in vain in the Sprinter user manual to see if there was some way to adjust the speaker output and solve the problem wihtout disabling the speaker.  With no other options available to try, I went ahead and pulled the power on the centre speaker.

I used a plastic knife to pry off the speake grill, removed the speaker from its retaining clips, located the purple wire connector, and pulled it free.  That's it - put it all back together and the overwhelming output from the centre speaker is gone.  Now, the left and right speakers can be discerned and be controlled normally using the audio system controls.

Is it much of an improvement?  Well, I'm no audiophile, but to me it made a significant difference.  No, I doubt that it is the same as driving around in a Mercedes touring coup listening to the Guess Who, but for a sound system in a van - it is way better than it was.  Very much worth the two minutes that it takes.
