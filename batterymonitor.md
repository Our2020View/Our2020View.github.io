When we made the decision to install lithium batteries we knew that we’d need a battery monitor of some sort.  All reports are true – you can’t tell the state of your lithium batteries just by looking at the voltage.  With a voltage drop under load, combined with the very consistent voltage while resting, you are just guessing what you have left in the tank.  After looking at all of the videos on YouTube, we opted for the Victron BMV 712 – mainly due to all of the good reviews and ease of installation.  Again, Grandpa Ron’s channel was very helpful during this selection.  Have a look at his installation here:

After having a close look at the battery box, and noting that things are pretty tight in there, I too elected to install the electronic shunt on the forward riser of the step.  (The shunt is essentially a break in the ground wire coming from the battery bank that temporarily diverts the current through an electronic meter. This electronic meter measures the current, leaving via a discharge or entering via a charge cycle, and keeps track of the numbers.  The Victron continually does the arithmetic and comes up with a continuous reading of your battery’s current state of charge.)  The install is not tricky; looking back I’d say the workload is getting the ground wires off the batteries and positioning them to be able to attach them to the output of the Victron shunt.

If you are swapping out your batteries to lithium or AGM, then this install fits nicely into all of the cable swaps that occur during the battery changeout.  The only caution I’d give is in regard to the ground wires – make sure you get ALL of the ground wires off of the batteries in order to allow the Victron to truly measure ALL of the current leaving and entering your battery bank.  There is no danger in leaving a stray ground wire attached to a negative post, but your Victron will not give you an accurate reading of battery state of charge.  In the View there are a total of four ground wires that have to be taken into account.  Three attach to the output of the shunt, and the fourth is the ground wire that leaves your battery bank and attaches to the input of the shunt.

I positioned the shunt on the riser of the step so that it was low enough not to interfere with any cable runs, but high enough to make access to the posts of the shunt easy to do when it came time to isolate the battery bank from the coach during the winterization process prior to winter storage.  (In the winter I disconnect the main ground cable attached to the input of the shunt and the two positive cables attached directly to the batteries, coming from the coach inputs.  This effectively isolates the lithium batteries and leaves them ready to sit happily for the winter)

I gave the decision to purchase the 712 instead of the 702 considerable thought, and elected on the Bluetooth connectivity feature.  I wasn’t sure if it would be useful, but ended up being sold on the easy method of updating the operating software.  And, it turns out; those software updates were very easy.  During the install, the first time I opened the app, it asked if I wanted to update and get things going.  Also, it turns out the decision go have the data on my phone was a very good idea.  The phone app provides a very intuitive interface, and allows for quick retrieval of information at a glance.  During the winter dry camping we did, I was constantly on the app monitoring what was going on to ensure we didn’t end up with a plumbing freeze up (see “Cold Weather Capability” and “Lithium Battery Heater”)

Here is a view of the shunt install, looking straight down into the battery box:  

You can see I positioned the shunt just off centre, in order to make the ground cables all fit comfortably.  There is one ground cable that comes from the coach into the battery box from the left side, and two ground cables that come from the coach into the battery box from the right side.  The fourth ground cable comes directly from the battery bank and is hooked up to the shunt input.  (The grey ground cable is the one from the battery bank, and there are three others in plactic looms that attach to the shunt output.  You can just see one of these cables from the right in this photo; and you can see the third one that comes from the left and is positioned underneath the grey cable)

Here is a shot of the stair riser, or the front of the battery box, with the bolt heads that attach the Victron shunt to the inside of the step riser:

Aother shot of the completed installation - this one has the temperture probe lead also inserted into the shunt:

So, I forgot to tell you that I purchased the temperature sensor as well.  I wanted to keep an eye on the battery temperature, knowing that we were venturing out into the cold.  It worked very well, and configuring the app to read this sensor was easy.  Now, you are just reading the temperature of one of the positive battery posts - but I guess that is pretty close to internal battery temperture.  I noticed that that the batteries start accepting a charge when my post temperture reaches -2 C.

And finally, here is what the app is showing you if you purchase the BMV 712:

The Victron gauge install in the panel above the cooktop was a little more extensive than the EMS gauge install, but more or less the same idea.  From the battery box I fed the BMV cable out through the left hand side cable entry, and drilled a hole in the neighboring locker near where the cables feeding the inverter can be found. From there I fed the cable up through the protective guard and into the base of the sink cabinet, following the path that the cables from the inverter follow. (There is an access panel on the floor of the sink cabinet that makes this pretty straightforward.)  Once the cable was under the cabinet, I fed an electricians's cable puller from the water heater area, under the fridge, under the cabinet with the pullout drawers, and then under the sink cabinet to the access panel area.  Then, I pulled back the cable to the water heater area.  Next, I used the same technique as I did on the EMS install - 

All in all, we are very happy with this purchase.  Working as advertised.
