When we made the decision to install lithium batteries we knew that we’d need a battery monitor of some sort.  All reports are true – you can’t tell the state of your lithium batteries just by looking at the voltage.  With a voltage drop under load, combined with the very consistent voltage while resting, you are just guessing what you have left in the tank.  After looking at all of the videos on YouTube, we opted for the Victron BMV 712 – mainly due to all of the good reviews and ease of installation.  Again, Grandpa Ron’s channel was very helpful during this selection.  Have a look at his installation here:

After having a close look at the battery box, and noting that things are pretty tight in there, I too elected to install the electronic shunt on the forward riser of the step.  (The shunt is essentially a break in the ground wire coming from the battery bank that temporarily diverts the current through an electronic meter. This electronic meter measures the current, leaving via a discharge or entering via a charge cycle, and keeps track of the numbers.  The Victron continually does the arithmetic and comes up with a continuous reading of your battery’s current state of charge.)  The install is not tricky; looking back I’d say the workload is getting the ground wires off the batteries and positioning them to be able to attach them to the output of the Victron shunt.

If you are swapping out your batteries to lithium or AGM, then this install fits nicely into all of the cable swaps that occur during the battery changeout.  The only caution I’d give is in regard to the ground wires – make sure you get ALL of the ground wires off of the batteries in order to allow the Victron to truly measure ALL of the current leaving and entering your battery bank.  There is no danger in leaving a stray ground wire attached to a negative post, but your Victron will not give you an accurate reading of battery state of charge.  In the View there are a total of four ground wires that have to be taken into account.  Three attach to the output of the shunt, and the fourth is the ground wire that leaves your battery bank and attaches to the input of the shunt.

I positioned the shunt on the riser of the step so that it was low enough not to interfere with any cable runs, but high enough make access to the posts of the shunt easy to do when it came time to isolate the battery bank from the coach during the winterization process prior to winter storage.  (In the winter I disconnect the main ground cable attached to the input of the shunt and the two positive cables attached directly to the batteries, coming from the coach inputs.  This effectively isolates the lithium batteries and leaves them ready to sit happily for the winter)

I gave the decision to purchase the 712 instead of the 702 considerable thought, and elected on the Bluetooth connectivity feature.  I wasn’t sure if it would be useful, but ended up being sold on the easy method of updating the operating software.  And, it turns out; those software updates were very easy.  During the install, the first time I opened the app, it asked if I wanted to update and get things going.  Also, it turns out the decision go have the data on my phone was a very good idea.  The phone app provides a very intuitive interface, and allows for quick retrieval of information at a glance.  During the winter dry camping we did, I was constantly on the app monitoring what was going on to ensure we didn’t end up with a plumbing freeze up (see “Cold Weather Capability” and “Lithium Battery Heater”)

I have not mounted the remote gauge yet, but plan on mounting it on the panel above the cook top – where the power switch for the tank heaters is and the inverter control.  To get there – I’ll route the Victron Ethernet cable from the battery box to the locker next door, up through the coach access the Xantrex XC uses to get under the sink, and then underneath the kitchen cupboard floor to the side of the fridge, up the side of the fridge and in behind the adjacent panel where the tank heater switch is.  (I will eventually get some photos of that process up on this page.) 

Here is a view of the shunt install, looking straight down into the battery box:  You can see I positioned the shunt just off centre, in order to make the ground cables all fit comfortably.  There is one ground cable that comes from the coach into the battery box from the left side, and two ground cables that come from the coach into the battery box from the right side.  The fourth ground cable comes directly from the battery bank and is hooked up to the shunt input.  The grey ground cable is the one from the battery bank, and there are three others in plactic looms that attach to the shunt output.
