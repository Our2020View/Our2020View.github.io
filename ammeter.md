title: Tank Heater Ammeter

Recently we were doing some late December dry camping, and needed the protection from the Winnebago installed holding tank heaters.  When I turned them on in the evening and watched my Victron app to take note of the amperage change, I noted that they were only pulling between 1 and 2 amps.  Those heaters are supposed to pull about 5 amps each at temperatures well below freezing, so I suspected we had a problem.  Doing a tactile check on the pads confirmed my suspicions, as I could not detect any heat on the pads anywhere.  

I can’t say that they have ever worked – the only other time I used them we were popping up above freezing during the daytime hours so the risk to the tanks was low - but thinking about it later, the current draw at that time was less than 2 amps as well.  I’m not sure what I am going to discover in the spring when I have a good look, as there are countless places where there could be a manufacturing error and they just were never going to operate as they should.

This time I checked the wiring where I could – voltage leaving the fuse box, voltage at the switch, voltage out of the switch -  I also did a half-hearted search for the ground wire on the fuse box -  but no luck anywhere  – so basically I gave up and assumed the problem was at the splitter for the pair of input and output wires, or somewhere that I never would be able to find.  I’m going on the assumption that I will have to run new wires from the heating pads, to ensure that I understand where everything is directed.

My thinking turned to a way to make darn sure these things are working in cold conditions when I flick the switch to ON.  Currently, the light in the switch only confirms that the switch has changed positions; it does not confirm that current is actually going to the heating pads.  So how about adding an ammeter to the circuit so I could see the 10 amps that is supposed to register?
After doing some research, it turns out that a fairly inexpensive ammeter can be purchased from Amazon, and installed relatively simply:

Come spring time, the plan will be to check the wiring at the pads themselves, and if I can’t find where the problem is - I’ll run new wires from the pads into the coach via the entry hole I cut for the gate valve heaters mod I did previously.  I know the power from the fuse box to the switch is good, so I will replace the Winnebago switch output wire with the new power line from the pads, and bring the new ground cable from the heating pads up to the recently purchased ammeter and then back down to the grounding bus on the fuse box.  In addition, I’ll need to add a new power line from the switch to the ammeter as well to make the gauge work.  The plan is to install the gauge up on the left side of the switch, on the panel behind the kitchen cabinet door above the stove top.

The vendor I purchased my ammeter from did not provide any instructions, but I found the info I needed on another vendor’s advertisement of the same type of product.  Here is an illustration of how the ammeter gets connected:

The left hand bronze terminal takes the new second power wire from the switch output, the middle silver terminal takes the ground wire from the heating pads, and the right hand silver terminal takes the new ground wire that goes back to the grounding post on the fuse box.  

(I checked to see if this thing was going to work by hooking up a test 12 volt light bulb circuit in the basement, and am happy to say that it correctly showed a voltage and an appropriate load.)

The web reports that these Therma Heat holding tank heater pads have a thermostat that controls operation with a turn on temperature of 45 degrees F (7 degrees C) and a turn off temperature of 67 degrees F (19 degrees C).  My assumption in all of this is I have a wiring issue, and not a problem associated with the two thermostats.

Time will tell.  I’ll report back when I get this one working.
