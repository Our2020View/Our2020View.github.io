title: Lithium Battery Heater

As you know, the only down side to having lithium batteries is that they are not happy charging at sub-zero internal temperatures.  Most of the RV lithium battery applications have a battery management system built in that prevents the destructive effects of cold charging by inhibiting a charge cycle if the temperature is too low.  The Battle Borns that we installed have one of these battery management systems.

Experiments I have done indicated that the BMS shuts down the charge cycle at about -2 degrees C, as measured at the terminal post the temperature sensor lead is attached to.  (I can’t say it was -2 C every time, but right around there.)  Knowing that we would be dry camping in sub-zero temperatures - the trick was going to be to keep the batteries warm enough to accept a charge again - when we woke up from a long winters night.  I thought of a bunch of schemes that involved thermal blankets, and researched battery warmers from our national institution up here – Canadian Tire.  These were pretty low wattage, so seemed like they might be Ok for current draw while dry camping.  But, after looking at the manufacturer’s specs, I noted that they were not recommended for lithium batteries because it was possible the blanket temperature could damage the lithium battery casing.  I’m not so sure about that, after talking with the vendor that sold me the batteries, but I elected to continue the search.  There are lots of solutions out there on the web for battery pads, but again, the pad temperatures were pretty high.

For starters, I settled on something I had in the basement - a low wattage therapeutic heating pad from Sunbeam (about 30.00 Cdn).  This pad has a .5 amp draw when on park shore power, and a 5 amp draw while on inverter power via the battery bank.  Experiments I did showed the surface only gets to about 40 degrees C on high, which makes sense when considering it is used for therapeutic heating.  Over that winter I did some experiments in the garage, and when an insulated lead acid battery was sitting on the pad, with the overlapped edges running up the battery sidewalls a bit, it took about 8 hours for a cold soaked battery at -11 C to warm up to over 0 C.  This does seem like a long time, but my thinking was that if I insulated the battery box well enough, and fired the heating pad up well in advance of cold exposure, I could maintain the battery above zero for the times I needed it heated.  Also, I have noted that the battery temperature does rise with use and charging – so internally it is helping out anyway.

During my first spring of dry camping in cold temperatures I found that ... yes, it did work.  Now, it was a bit clunky, as I had to run the pad wiring out the step well and plug it in to an outlet over the cooktop.  But, the important part – if I had the pad plugged in well in advance of cold overnight lows, the battery temperature did not go anywhere near sub zero.  (Hey – maybe it would not have dropped below subzero anyway just due to the thermal mass of a battery, but with the pad operating there was absolutely no issues of finding out the hard way that I needed some sort of supplementary heat.)

Now, there was a fairly big drawback using the Sunbeam heating pad I had in the basement – the pad controller had an auto shutoff set for two hours.  That meant that during the day, while driving in cold weather, we had to remember to recycle the controller every now and then to ensure we had continuous heat being applied.  While camped at the end of the day – same drill.  And, just before going to bed we had reset it to get that two hours before it went dormant for the night.  If we remembered to do these resets, it worked like a champ.

The plan is to bypass the auto shutoff function in the controller someday, and also add a receptacle on the entry side wall of the kitchen base cabinet to be able to easily plug in the pad.   (The receptacle will have a split circuit – one plug will be a dedicated 20 amp circuit for an electric heater, and the other plug will be tied to the house 15 amp receptacles using the existing inverter capable supply.)  I had considered continuing my search to find a pad that did not have the auto off function, but now that I have it installed and working so well, I think I will spend the time to eliminate the auto off nuisance.  

The installation was not too bad – but since I already had the lithium batteries installed, I had to remove them and do it all over again.  The workload was going through the process of disconnecting and then re-connecting the cables when the insulation was in.  Insulating the battery box was straightforward enough; I used what I had on hand.  I cut up a foam rubber tile used for cushioning on the basement floor for the batteries to sit on, found a sheet of packing insulation that worked well for the back of the battery box, and then used pink fibreglass insulation for the bulk of the cavity to close it off from the outside.  (I packed the outside exposed insulation in plastic bags to protect it from external elements.)

There were two snags, both tied to the fact that I tried to retain the Winnebago battery retention system.  Because the batteries now sat taller due to the foam pad they were sitting on, the threaded rod was not long enough to meet the hold-down bracket.  And, the bracket had to be flipped upside down to be able to match up with the threaded nut attached to the back wall of the battery box.  I had to head out and pickup some threaded rod and washers and nuts in order to get the job done. 

Once the batteries were positioned on the matt, with the extra pad width overlapping the back of the batteries up the rear wall, coverage was pretty good.  There was about a half of an inch on each end without any coverage, and I left zero overlap on the front of the batteries so there was no danger of the threaded rods damaging the pad while the coach is in motion (not very likely, but a consideration).  Jamming in insulation to close off the box was the last step.


Here is what I started with - the pad had a soft cover that was removed:
