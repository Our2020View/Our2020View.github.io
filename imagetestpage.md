What is a Macerator Pump, and why is it in the Electrical section of this webpage?  A macerator pump is a marine sewage pump hooked up downstream of your black and grey water discharge system, and is responsible for delivering chocolate milk and dish soap foam to the dump station inlet.  The manufacturer of our previous Class B motor homes used to advertise “No mess, No fuss”.  It turns out this advertising was actually very true, and we have considered a macerator pump to be a necessity for any motor home we drive.

The View, as of 2020, does not have a true macerator pump setup on any of its View / Navion lineup.  The closest Winnebago comes to a true setup is a macerator pump installed in the grey water dump line of the 24V model.  On this model, its purpose is to pump grey water from the tank, as they have some geometry challenges with relying on gravity to get the job done.  (I seem to recall they have to get the line over the rear axle.)  But, c’mon... grey water?  Isn’t that a waste of a macerator pump?

So, full disclosure.  I don’t have a lot of experience using the traditional “blue slinky of death” during dump duties.  For the entire time we have been RVing in a motor home, we have been spoiled by the dump functionality we have come to expect as normal operations.  We round the corner into the dump station, and take note of the rig pulling up beside us in the other lane.  I jump out, don my work gloves, open up the lid on the dump station inlet, flip open the dump service panel door, yank out the dump hose, pull the black valve T handle, and then look up to see my wife smiling back at me.  With a nod of my head, she hits the in-coach button on the remote panel to turn on the macerator pump to start delivering that chocolate milk I was telling you about.  So far this has taken about 30 seconds to
