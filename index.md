<h1>Welcome to our Motor Home Mod Site!</h1>

Hello!  Our 2020 View website is a website dedicated to giving RV Enthusiasts ideas based on what we have done to modify our motor home.  This is not a “How To” website, but rather a “How We Did It” website. 
My wife and I have been RVing for over 30 years, with the last many years being in a series of Class B camper vans.  Our latest motor home is the one this website is focused on – Our 2020 Winnebago View 24J Class C motor home.
If you are like me, you might enjoy scouring the web to find out what other RVers have done to improve the functionality of their rigs.  If there is anything on these pages that give you some ideas, we are glad to share.  The web is full of really great content supplied by very skilled modifiers, so I’ll try to point out where I got some help along the way as we accomplished these mods.
