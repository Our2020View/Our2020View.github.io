title: Installing Lithium Batteries in an RV

Our lithium upgrade to two Battle Born BB10012 100 amp hour batteries was the first mod we did – and we chose this mod for a few reasons.  I wanted the weight reduction it would give us, as we have plans to pick the kids up every now and then and travel as a family of four.  With four in the coach, and loaded for an epic adventure, there is very little margin to the Sprinter’s max weight of 11,030 pounds.  Every pound counts.  Another reason, of course, was we wanted to capitalize on the advertised increase in useful battery capacity – at least double the available power?  That sounds good!  And the last reason, but not the least, was to stop the painful exercise of removing the batteries for the winter and hauling them into the basement to keep warm.  The AGMs in our last Class B were mounted up in the top right hand corner of the Sprinter’s engine compartment, and were a real bear to remove.  Weighing in at close to 60 pounds each, it took two of us to remove them and every year would result in some form of back pain that would stick with me for weeks.  Sure... we didn’t have to remove them, but we have lost batteries over the winter at the temperatures we get up here so I started that practice many years ago.  Following this practice both for our coach and chassis batteries had made them problem free ever since (but not my back).  Now, with the lithium coach batteries, I can leave them in all winter and not worry about any issues.

The install was very straightforward, with only one snag popping up:  The Winnebago paralleling cables connecting the batteries were not quite long enough for the terminal post locations on the new Battle Borns, so I had to drop tools and go hunt down some new cables.  I bought a couple of 2/0 AWG 18” cables with 3/8” connectors, and they worked fine.  (The wire gauge is super important - when the microwave is being fed from the batteries via the inverter, you are pulling around 160 amps!  Don’t skimp!)

I did not take the time to investigate flipping the batteries around so the posts were at the bottom: I just emulated the battery configuration that Winnebago settled on, thinking that my best chance of using their cables would be if I did the same layout.  The Battle Born terminal posts are a bit of a pain; it would have been nicer to have the option to mount the cables with a bit more room to get tools on the lug bolts.  But, the initial install was relatively quick, aside from the search for new paralleling cables...

Now, when I later added the Victron BMV 712, a heating pad, and insulated the battery box - things got interesting as space became a premium.  The batteries had to sit higher because of the rubber matt and heating pad they were resting on, and the batteries also had to move forward a bit to get some insulation on the back wall of the battery box.  Also, the ground cables had to be re-arranged to get hooked up to the Victron shunt.  But, those details are contained in another mod description.

This is a photo of the Winnebago battery configuration - Until I became familiar with the cable orientation, I numbered them all to ensure I started off with the same placement as Winnebago had left them in:

You can see that the batteries are essentially open to the outside world, in order to get a traditional lead acid battery venting safely:  Later on when I installed a warming pad for these lithium batteries, I enclosed the battery box as best I could.

These shots show the weight comparison of the lead acid vs the Battle Born lithium batteries.  Not quite a 50% reduction in weight, but pretty close:

Replicating what Winnebago had done regarding cable placement got us up and running fairly quickly.

So, how do we like these batteries?  Well, we are thrilled with them.  In a load test I did, the advertised amp hour rating was shown to be conservative and the performance was jaw dropping compared to my experience with lead acid batteries, even AGM batteries.  (The factory batteries were not AGM batteries, so this is a huge step up in performance.)

In the test I did, at the recommnedation of the vendor who sold me the  batteries, I hooked up a heater and used the 750 watt setting to watch the performance.  My Victron BMV 712 bluetooth app was handy to see everything unfold.  Doing the arithmetic, I calculated that I should get 2.5 hours of heater operation out of the 200 amp hours of available Battle Born power.  In the end, I exceeded 2.5 hours and also got more than 200 amp hours before I ended the test.  I had expected the batteries to shut down at around 10 volts, but as you can see from the screen shot below, they were still humming along at less than 10 volts!  It was here that I chickened out and ended the test.  (I don't know about you, but I was very impressed that these things would push out 85 to 95 amps for over 2.5 hours!)

We have done a bunch of dry camping in mid spring conditions, and are extremely happy with the battery capacity and charging rate provided by the generator.  I have the Xantrex XC converter / inverter set to a max charge rate of 60 amps, and we get pretty close to this when the generator is charging them up.

Working as advertised.
