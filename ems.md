* I Have not done this mod yet as of April 2021.  Text below is preliminary.

I don’t have a lot to say about the background to this modification, other than the money we spent is considered insurance and peace of mind as we operate our motor home all over the place in all kinds of campgrounds and in all kinds of weather.  There is a good amount of details available out there on the web to those who are considering an EMS purchase.

We chose the Progressive Industries EMS – HW30C as our EMS.  The company looks to have excellent product support and installation videos, and some folks have detailed their installations on YouTube as well.  One source I found quite useful during this research and installation was Grandpa Ron’s YouTube channel “On the Road with Ron”.  Grandpa Ron has a View as well, and his information found in his [“RV Surge Protector” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0yRcqbuoOk) made a lot of sense to me.  I essentially duplicated his insall, but plan to mount the display on the panel with the water tank heaters switch.  I think it will be useful to see how much current we are pulliing when we use a combination of appliances on shore or generator powerer.  The Xantrex XC has that information, but is pretty course.

Do you need one?  That depends on your comfort level, I guess.  For lightning strikes, I think you would be Ok without one as there is a surge suppressor built into the 2020’s new automatic transfer switch hooked up downstream of the shore power.  For every other electrical hazard that can cause grief to onboard equipment and inhabitants in our motor home?  No, there is no protection from these other hazards, so we spent the money to not have to worry about them.  (We did not have an EMS on our previous Class B motor homes, but we felt we wanted to do it right on this purchase.)

Was it worth it?  Don’t know... I have not noticed any demonic electrical hazards lurking around out there yet.  Do I sleep well at night?  I will when I actually get this installed!
