After coming home from a two month trip where we faced extremely strong crosswinds while crossing the prairies, and excessive amounts of daily activations of the dreaded crosswind assist and stability control “features” of the Sprinter chassis, I started thinking about those Sprinter suspension upgrades that the Internet is so fond of...

Sumo Springs, Koni shocks, Hellwig sway bars, Agile Off Road Fox shocks, Bilstein shocks... there are a number of options out there that are recommended as easy upgrades.  But which to choose?  The Winnebago Forum seems to have an overwhelming majority vote for the Agile Off Road Fox 2.5 shocks as a must have, and then folks seem to either upgrade the sway bar or replace the factory rubber stop blocks with Sumo Springs.  I always look for well presented facts when surfing for RV mod info, and not surprisingly this particular site had a very good story for the suspension upgrade configuration that was chosen for their View:

The real world experience information found on the above page was valuable, and when taking into account the other information on the Winnebago Forum, it became an easy decision for me:

[1 – Agile Off Road AO Fox 2.5 Sprinter 3500 rear shocks](https://agileoffroad.com/product/agile-fox-2-5-rear-shocks-mercedes-sprinter-3500-rv-class-c/)

[2 – Hellwig sway bar for a VS30 Sprinter (2019 – to present) Part number 7777](https://www.hellwigproducts.com/our-products/search/?searchq=7777)  

(Part number 7254 for the pre 2019  Sprinter 3500 chassis)

I got lucky on the parts and found sources for each up here in Canada, and received them within a week of ordering.

<h4>Installation</h4>

Everything I have read regarding the DIY installation of both of these components has indicated that it is not too bad of a job.  There are lots of videos on YouTube for each of these installations, and certainly with the capability to get the rear end elevated a bit – I’m guessing that the job is made quite a bit easier.  Our installation was done with the View flat on the driveway, with no elevation of any kind.  Also, I did not have a helper for either job, and I had no prior experience doing chassis mods like these.

It looks like the Newstate Nomads did these mods with their View flat on the ground too; here is the video that gave me reason to give both these installations a try:

And here is another helpful video from “rv life diy” that makes the sway bar install look pretty straightforward, but note he has used his coach leveling system to get some extra room under there...

Here are the installation instructions for each mod:

Well, I got ‘er done in about six hours – both the shock and sway bar installation.  However - it was an awful lot of restricted area, extremely awkward, manoeuvring with the View flat on the driveway – tool manipulation was tough due to limited options caused by the chassis being so low to the ground – using a floor jack to compress the shock was very tricky without a helper – and that sway bar is pretty heavy to be jostling around in a confined area and difficult to get started with just one hand.  Would I do it again?  Probably not.  No, I think if I had to do it again I would just pay the 300 bucks to have the pros at the local garage do it for me.  

<h4>Performance</h4>

It is still too early for us to determine if these mods have helped the wind and semi truck sway issues at highway speeds as much as everyone else has reported, but the testing we have done in parking lots and city streets over speed bumps taken on the diagonal have indicated that the reduction in lateral sway and wallow is phenomenal compared to what it used to be.  Things are looking good.  I’ll update this page when we have got some miles under our belts and real world highway experience.
