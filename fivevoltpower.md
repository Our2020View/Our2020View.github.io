Here is a mod that might be useful for those looking to get 5 volt or 12 volt power to a rear view camera.  In our particular case, we used it to get 5 volt USB charging to the Auto-Vox Solar 4 wireless rear view camera that we installed to give us full time rear view awareness.  Here is a link to that mod we did awhile back:

As explained on the above mod page, the solar charging works really well - when the sun is shining.  But, we found that running the system in cloudy weather will result in only a two or three day charge, and if you have a long string of cloudy days the system will eventually run out of battery power and shut itself down.  That's where this mod comes in.  If your travels are taking you into all sorts of weather, and you don't want the inconvenience of not having a rear view camera system every now and then, a full time charging system to the camera battery is a requirement.

This mod will also work for you if you are looking for a general solution to getting 5 or 12 volts to something at the rear of your trailer or motorhome - whether is is a solar powered camera or a conventionaly powered camera, or something else...

The general concept for this one was to "borrow" 12 volts from a nearby running light, and in our case, step that 12 volts down to 5 volts for use in a USB charging chord.  (Our Auto-Vox battery powered camera requires 5 volt USB charging, but if you've got a 12 volt camera you can skip that voltage drop step.)  In order to step 12 volts down to 5 volts, we picked up a voltage converter from Amazon:

The USB plug that came with the voltage converter did not physically fit into our Auto-Vox camera, so we had to replace a portion of the USB cable that came with the converter, with the spare USB cable that came with the Auto-Vox system.  It was not a big deal, as there were only a power wire and a negative wire in the charging cables so the butt connections was straightforward.  Here is a photo of our converter, after splicing on the spare USB cable that came with the Auto-Vox system:
