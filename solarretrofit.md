Note:  I'm waiting for warm temperatures in the spring to install this one.

I’ve got mixed feelings on this mod – I’m glad to be adding some more solar capability to the View, but I’m disappointed that I have to replace the existing flex panels after only a couple of years of use.  People have been reporting that the factory 100 watt Sunpower panels have been scorching their thin Filon fibreglass veneer on the View’s roof, and I’ve noticed a drop in performance of our factory panels over the short period that we have been using them.  So, time to fix both those issues while increasing our charging capability to the lithium coach batteries.

The general concept for this mod involved removing the two 100 watt Sunpower flex panels that were screwed into the roof, and replacing them with four 100 watt rigid panels mounted on a track system – without having to modify the Winnebago solar roof port system or Zamp solar controller.

Installation Considerations:

1 – How to attach the new panels to the roof?  No new holes was my number one priority, so choosing a method to accomplish that was given a lot of thought.

2 – Having to go through the process of removing the factory flex panels, screwed to the roof, I thought it would be a good idea to make this next panel installation easily removable with no impact on the fibreglass surface.  I wanted a system that would make maintaining or replacing panels on the roof a quick and painless event.

3 – Did I want the added weight four rigid panels and all the installation hardware would bring?

4 – Should I add more than 400 watts?  Other folks have been adding quite a bit more solar capability to their Views...

Here is what I came up with...

After looking at numerous installations on both YouTube and the Winnebago owner’s forum, I settled on the 3M 4950 VHB double sided tape option for securing the panels to the roof.  AM Solar out of Springfield, Oregon, has pioneered the use of VHB tape for solar panel retention and offers this as a vote of confidence:

<i>“Fiberglass roofs – We have been using a type of 3M double-sided tape on our mounts since the mid 1990’s, and we have never lost a panel.  As long as the tape is properly installed on a clean surface at the correct temperature, it will hold.  As an added level of protection, we use a layer of Dicor self-leveling sealant around the entire perimeter of the mount, and cover the screw holes/heads as well.  The sealant protects the tape and any potential roof penetrations from water intrusion and decay.  Some customers use the screws for an added layer of protection on fiberglass roofs, but we haven’t found that to be necessary.”</i>

<i>“Rubber Roofs – Along with the 3M double-sided tape, we also include stainless steel ¾” sheet metal screws in the Rocker Foot Mount Set.  While the 3M tape will hold to your rubber roof, your rubber roof may not stay attached to the plywood it is bonded to.  The sheet metal screws will penetrate through the rubber, into the plywood, to keep your rubber roof from separating while the wind force of highway speed driving pulls at your panels.  Again, we bury the entire mounting feet with Dicor self-leveling sealant for weather resistance.”</i>  

Ok, so a well respected national leader in solar panel installation has never lost a panel when using VHB tape... how much tape do they use?  They don’t use that much, actually.  If you go to their site and shop for replacement feet, you will see that they only use a 1” wide strip 2.5” long on each foot.  2.5 square inches for each foot gives you ten square inches of adhesion footprint total.  The 3M 4950 VHB tape is rated for 140 lbs of tensile pull strength per square inch, so that works out to 1400 lbs of vertical pull force on a panel.  Seems like quite a bit of safety margin...

Grandpa Ron added a new panel using the AM Solar method – his installation video can be found here:

Grandpa Ron sounds pretty confident in the use of the tape; it sounds like he has industry experience that has formed that opinion.  Between Grandpa Ron, AM Solar, and a bazillion other RVers out there who have installed panels using VHB 4950 tape, the tape / no holes method was looking like a winner.  

But, just how much wind do these panels really see?  Lots of RVers use the VHB tape, but then go ahead and screw them down anyway to gaurd against them "flying away".  Why bother with the tape, then?  The use of screws and well nuts seems to be a common practice for those that don’t trust the tape, but do we really expect these panels to “fly away” at highway speeds using the tape alone?  Do the panels actually experience the full airflow associated with highway speeds?  My suspicion was ... no, but that was just a guess from trying to visualize what the flow would look like on top of the roof.  To answer the question, I bought an anemometer, attached it to a suction cup, put it on the roof, and did some highway trials.  I have to admit, I was a bit surprised at the results...

I measured the airspeed at six locations on the left hand side of the roof, where the air would have the best chance of re-attaching after it came over the bunk.  (I wanted to measure the fastest moving air on the roof, and felt that the protuberances on the right hand side of the roof would create turbulence resulting in lower speeds.)  The anemometer was positioned about 1/2 of an inch from the surface, and I did the tests at a vehicle odometer speed of 71 mph (115 kmh).

These photos show where and how I measured the airspeed:

<img src="/assets/webairspeed2.jpg"/>   

<img src="/assets/webairspeed1.jpg"/>   

The speed just aft of the bunk seam met expectations; it was quite low, about 24% of vehicle speed.  The speeds in the middle of the roof, at 4, 6, and 8 feet aft of the bunk lip were pretty consisent at about 75% of vehicle speed.  The speed at 10 feet aft of the bunk lip was down a bit, at 63% of vehicle speed.  (I attempted to measure the speed of the air on top of the bunk, but my Amazon $23.00 anemometer gave up the ghost at this point and was history.  Not really knowing what the speed of the air coming over the bunk was did not  make for a good apples to apples comparison, but using a percentage of vehicle speed gives me a general idea of what our panels will be seeing.)  We cruise at 62 mph (100 kph), so I'm going to go with 45 mph (76 kmh) as an approximate cruise airspeed that our panels will experience.  During times at passing speeds, they will see about 55 mph (88 kmh). 

Is there any merit to these tests?  Well, it depends on what we are going for here.  But, I think I can say with confidence that the air downstream of the bunk lip on the left hand side does a pretty good job of re-attaching and reaching some impressive speeds.  If the panels were mounted with a bit of incidence, I might be concerned about the potential to create lift - but with the panels flat and the air able to flow under the panels as well, I'm guessing that the capability to produe lift will be minimal.  (I might give some thought to mounting the panels with a negative angle of incidence ...)  Having said that, it might come back to relying on the hold down strength of the tape, and its good history.  AM Solar uses 10 square inches of tape - I plan on using 96 square inches of tape.  AM Solar's tensile strength is 1400 pounds per panel, mine will be 13,500 pounds per panel- should be good enough...

Ok, I originally made the decision to use the VHB tape and started into the same type of installation that Grandpa Ron had done – but elected to use six feet, instead of just four.  (This would have given me a 50% increase in factor of safety compared to the AM Solar method.)  I came very close to getting up on the roof and starting into it, but due to the onset of a cool fall season, I ran out of consistent ambient temperatures that fell within the VHB tape installation guidelines.  I had everything ready to go, but was forced to drop tools and sit on the installation until the next spring and the arrival of warmer temperatures.

It turns out this was not a bad turn of events, for I started questioning the advisability of attaching panels to the roof with no easy way of removing them.  That is when I noticed Brian of “RV with Tito” had come up with an installation system that used Utility T Track, and his project looked pretty good - as usual:

I have always envied those that have roof racks that can be used as the supports for a solar install, so the idea of using Utility T Track looked like the next best thing.  In addition to being able to remove a malfunctioning panel quickly and easily, the added adhesion footprint that the T Track gave was the clincher – If AM Solar was happy with ten square inches of VHB footprint for the large panels they install, how about 9 times more adhesion than that for these small panels?

So, with a long winter ahead to change direction and plan an installation using Utility T Track, here is what my supplies list generally ended up being - with links to the products:

Do you need a fuse on the direct output of a solar panel?  Well, good question.  Our View has a 15 amp fuse on each of the current panels on the roof – I assume that Winnebago and Zamp decided this was necessary to protect the input to the controller.  (The battery charge wiring output from the controller is protected by the 30 amp solar circuit breaker under the passenger seat.)  Using the Winnebago and Zamp guidance, a 20 amp fuse to protect the combination of the output of the additional two panels made sense.

I chose the Renogy feet to keep things simple - as they were designed for their panels.

<a href = "https://www.tegstools.com/rok-44166-4-ft-aluminum-mitre-track " target="_blank">1 ¼” Utility T track </a>

Most of the Utility T Track installations that I researched online had used ¾” track, but I chose 1 ¼” T Track to allow the use of a full wide strip of 1” VHB tape.  ¾” VHB tape is not as easy to find, and I liked the idea of more adhesion footprint.

The T Track I chose really lends itself to needing some sort of bolt anchor, due to the width of the track.  A ¾” track would allow just a bolt insert, but the 1 ¼” wide track is too wide for that practically.  Here is a photo of the mounts I purchased, being used in a carpentry application:

<img src="/assets/websolarretrofit10.jpg"/>   

¼” – 20 ½” bolts, nuts, lock washers, all stainless steel – These bolts are more heavy-duty than the bolts that attach the feet to the panels, so I considered going a bit smaller to match those bolts ... but in the end I went with these ¼” – 20 bolts, as they were pretty easy to find and fit the track fasteners nicely.

#12 AWG wire, butt splice connectors, and shrink wrap tubes, sealant

How much extra did this all weigh?  The panels and feet are 15 lbs each, the Utility T Tracks per panel add another 3 lbs, and the miscellaneous wiring, connectors, and sealant was probably about 3 lbs total.  I took credit for the weight saving of removing the flex panels; about 8 lbs.  That all comes in around 67 lbs, but when taking credit for the rear stabilizers that I removed, the net additional weight totals about 27 lbs.  I rationalized this as a good deal for a theoretical 400 watts of solar capacity that actually had a good chance of working for awhile.

Was 400 watts going to be enough?  I saw that some View owners were coming up with 600 watts for their retrofits – but I did notice one significant drawback to this concept – available real estate on the roof to walk around and maintain things.  At some point I’ll have all of that roof sealant to replace, and I felt I should plan for a comfortable work environment to do that and other roof maintenance jobs without having to remove the panels.    Also, our Zamp solar controller is only rated for 510 watts total, and they recommend only a maximum of 450 watts on the roof to allow some margin for the ground based 150 watt panel you can add via the port in the electrical bay – I didn’t want to get involved in adding a different solar controller – so, no, 400 watts capability / 20 amps of charging was about all I felt we needed.

With the supplies in the basement and a plan in hand, all I have to do now is wait for warmer temperatures in the spring to do the retrofit.  I'll let you know how it all goes...
