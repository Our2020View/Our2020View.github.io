Resistance is Futile... these things are going to be worth it.  

Our View came with the same plastic valve stem extensions that our previous Class B Sprinter had - the plastic valve stem extensions that leaked and were tough to get air into.  On our next trip through Iowa the plan is to stop in at Lichtsinn RV in Forest City and get some Borg extra long valve stems installed.  I'll let you know how that all goes...
