Resistance is Futile... these things are going to be worth it.  

Our View came with the same plastic valve extensions as our Previous Class B Sprinter had, the plastic valve extensions that leaked.  On our next trip through Iowa the plan is to stop in at Lichtsinn RV in Forest City and get some Borg valve stem extensions installed.
