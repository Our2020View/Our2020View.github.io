description: Nervous about getting your RV Rustproofed?  It will be Ok ...

In the past we have tried not to run our motorhomes up here during the Canadian winter - the challenges were our previous coaches were not winter capable, and we also didn't want to expose our cottage on wheels to a slow, rusty, death.  This time, when choosing our Winnegago View / Navion, we elected to take a deep breath and see if we could enjoy RVing year round.  We did some mods to the coach that have allowed us to meet the first challenge, and then elected to get the Sprinter and coach rustproofed to meet the second challenge.

We took the View to our local Krown Rust Control dealer, and I am very happy to report that we had a very positive experience.  They were experienced with motorhomes, and therefore were familiar with the systems underneath and knew what to treat and what not to treat.  Their first step was to carefully treat the under the hood components that are susceptible to corrosion, and then followed that up by creating access ports on the cab panels to allow them to apply the treatment to the inside of the front chassis cavities.  Once up on the hoist, they pressure washed the undercarriage, air dried it, and then applied the treatment to the Sprinter chassis structure and coach areas of special interest.  These coach areas included any steel support structure that Winnebago uses for their systems, such as the propane tank and supports and the rear stabilizer assembly.  Once complete, they dropped it to the ground, soaped it up and then pressure washed the lower motorhome body.

The appointment took about 45 minutes, and the bill was 180.00 Cdn tax in.

I'm always a bit nervous when I see someone else driving our motorhome away to accomplish some sort of servicing ("you guys backed it into what?"), but this particular Krown location had an observation area where I could keep an eye on the whole process.  It looked like they really knew what they were doing, and they demonstrated that they knew how to drive large trucks without damaging them - unlike our Mercedes dealer (twice).

All in all, very pleased.
