I recently tried to get the coach rustproofed at a local Krown dealer - despite fully briefing them in advance on the size of our View, upon arriving they said they could not accomodate the coach in their service bay.  Evidently they have an exterior service  bay that they do large vehicles, but it was closed for the winter at the time of my appointment.  

More to come on this one...
