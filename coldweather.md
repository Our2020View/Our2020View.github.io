title: RV Cold Weather Capability

One of the reasons we chose a View / Navion was because we felt the goal of being able to camp during cold temperatures was within reach.  We were impressed that the fresh water tank and associated delivery plumbing was above the floor in the coach, and the Truma hot water system had a recirculation feature that would take care of any potential for the hot water lines to get cold.  The general feeling was that if we could keep warm in the winter – the plumbing system was likely to be Ok as well.  There are many reports on the web of being able to camp successfully in a View / Navion in the winter, so we crossed out fingers and hoped that those early spring and late fall nights could be tolerated, and cruising down the highway when the temperatures were below zero would be Ok as well.

But ... then I found this video by the Newstate Nomads:

[View/Navion wet bay freeze up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZOGvqfBxvw&t=189s)

This was great to discover, as I had been wondering about the wet bay design and how that spaghetti box of exposed plumbing made its way into the heated area of the coach.  However, just watching this video, I couldn’t visualize exactly where the heat was being applied to solve the problem.  Looking at the drawings helped a bit, but they do leave quite a bit to the imagination.

Here is a drawing of the plumbing directly behind the wet bay panel ... it is very easy to see why things freeze up when temperatures drop.

And, here is a partial photo of what the area behind the wet bay panel looks like:

Here is a view of under the shower - You can see the square hole cut in the floor just above the wet bay:

It wasn’t until I could get to the RV that first spring that things all came into focus... the electrical area of the locker is fully open to the back of the wet bay and up to the floor of the shower!  The back of the wet bay, and floor of the shower area, is open to air exposed to that locker with no insulation of any kind.  Winnebago has provided a propane powered heat duct to the water pump area and plumbing coming from the wet bay, but the wet bay plumbing is not protected.

If you stick your camera in far enough to the elecrical side of that wet bay locker, you'll see that square hole and the plumbing for the shower:

Here is another view, looking into the locker from the street:

So, after giving this some thought, and remembering how we keep warm while camping, some areas requiring consideration started to become clear.

When using shore power, we use independent electric heat to warm the coach.  Winnebago has used the propane furnace duct system to provide warmth to the plumbing, and even has a loose duct underneath the bed in the aft equipment bay that can be directed at the water pump or under the shower (but it is not long enough to get to the wet bay!).  However, when using electric heat, the plumbing pipes don’t get direct warmth from the furnace ducts.

Consideration 1 – The wet bay needs to be heated regardless of which type of heat is used.

Consideration 2 – Experiments I did in early spring showed that electric heat in the coach was not good enough to penetrate the bed area and heat the area of the water tank and water pump.  Some sort of heating is required for the water pump and feed lines.

Consideration 3 – If the Truma is powered up and in “comfort” mode, there is no need to worry.  But, if DRIVING in cold weather, either the Truma needs to be drained, or the commercially available “Truma auxillary electric heating system” needs to be installed to keep the Truma system from freezing.

Consideration 4 – Can I power whatever I come up with while dry camping, with no shore power plugged in?

Some things to think about!  Here is what I came up with:

Consideration 1 – heating the wet bay

After spending a considerable amount of time coming up with exceptionally clever, but overly complex and unrealistically impractical, ways to insulate and heat that area, I opted for the same method that is shown in the video above:  a trouble lamp with an old fashioned incandescent light bulb.  Knowing that a 75W bulb was enough to thaw the frozen PEX in the video, I figured that the same would be enough to keep the area warm and prevent freezing in the first place.  A low wattage light bulb – simple and safe... I like simple and safe...

How do you get at the back of the wet bay to stuff some insulation in there?  Well, Winnebago has installed a bottom of the locker access panel to both the wet bay and the electrical storage bay.  That black metal strap that initially looks like support structure, is actually the access panel.

Removing it is easy, and allows pretty good access to the back of the wet bay panel.  Here are a couple of photos of the panel removed, and the start of my insulation work:

<img src="/assets/5viewinacesspanel2web.jpg"/>

I laid in some pink fibreglass R15 insulation to the walls of the wet bay box, and to the floor as well.  I didn’t go crazy, as the whole idea was to leave an air cavity that could be heated by the trouble lamp.  After getting the insulation in, I tied one of the temperature probes from a monitoring system I purchased - up to a lanyard, and dropped it in the wet bay.  

The trouble lamp itself was inserted from the electrical storage side of the locker, and the chord was fed straight up underneath the shower pan and out towards the water pump and under-bed aft equipment bay area.  From there, the chord was fed into the hot water area, and then around the corner, and stored loose under the fridge where it can be hidden until needed.  When needed, I tug the chord out and plug it in to the 120V outlet at the foot of the bed.

With the trouble light sitting on the bed of insulation, with the bulb positioned up to the plumbing, I closed off the wet bay area from the electrical area with more pink insulation.

It works very, very, well.  With outside temperatures approaching – 13 C, the wet bay was maintained well above freezing with a 60W incandescent light bulb.  The rating on the trouble lamp is 75W, but up here in Canada you can’t buy incandescent light bulbs any longer of that wattage.  All I could find was 50W or 60W “rough service” bulbs, so I’ll keep my eye open for other options when on the road.

Consideration 2 – heating the water pump area

Well, a trouble light in the wet bay worked so well, why not a trouble light near the water pump?  I hung a couple of lights above the pump, and during spring tests was able to keep the area well above freezing when the coach was sub-zero.  I resorted to two lights, as all I could find were 50W “rough service” bulbs in our area.  I plugged one light into the other, and then fed the remaining chord along the same path as I had used for the wet bay heat.  Two 50W bulbs was plenty of heat, so sometimes I turned one light off and just had one bulb powered.  (I put velcro on this water pump acess panel to make entry easier)  In the right side of this picture, you can see the orange chord coming from the wet bay trouble light, and also the loose propane furnace heat duct that you can position  as you see fit.  I have ours aimed at the water pump feed area.

Consideration 3 – keeping the Truma happy during sub-zero travel

On previous motorhomes, we had a big six gallon propane water heater that was not going to freeze during transit through cold weather.  But, as with a standard hot water tank system, you can’t run the propane to keep the Truma happy while driving.  To solve this one, I resorted to purchasing the Truma Aqua Go Electric Anti-freeze Kit.

[Truma Aqua Go Electric Anti-freeze Kit]( https://shop.truma.net/products/aquago-electric-antifreeze-kit)

Installation was easy, and operation is simple.  Don’t forget to include the step to select the anti-freeze system on the Truma rotary control knob prior to travel in cold weather to your departure checklist!

Now - there is another option, other than purchasing this component, but it involves fixing a flaw in the Winnebago winterization procedure associated with the Truma system.  If fixed, you can easily drain the Truma without winterizing the rest of the coach plumbing system.  It is a very easy fix – If you are interested, have a look at the mod page I did for this one.

Consideration 4 – Can I power this stuff while dry camping, with no shore power plugged in?

While sitting at a campsite with shore power, powering the trouble lamps in the wet bay and pump area is no problem.  But, while dry camping, you will have to power the outlet at the foot of the bed with inverter power.  The inverter itself draws about two amps, and plan on about five amps for each bulb you have lit in your heating system.  (Don’t forget that even though a 60W light bulb only pulls a half of an amp on household hydro, you are creating that household power via the inverter powered from your 12V batteries.  Amps go way up when produced from the low voltage of a 12V battery system.)  When combined with the fridge and other overnight dry camping electrical draws, you will be temporarily closing in on 20 amps when the fridge is in its duty cycle pulling about 5 amps.  Have a close look to see if your battery system can handle this.  Our 200 amp hours of Lithium power can easily take this draw for more than 10 hours, but the standard lead acid batteries from Winnebago will find this challenging.  Supplementing the batteries with the generator might be warranted if you have to dry camp with the heat on for any length of time.  

So, how did all of this turn out?

It turns out it was all very worthwhile.  In the spring of '21 during the Pandemic, a family emergency forced us to dig the View out of a snow bank and dry camp in sub zero temperatures out of town at a Walmart.  We don’t use the propane heat while sleeping, instead we prefer to stay warm in our winter bags and then use the furnace to come back up to temperature in the morning.  With the light bulbs powered to keep the wet bay and water pump area warm, the Truma circulating hot water throughout the kitchen and bath plumbing systems, and with other coach normal system current draws, we used about 40% of our batteries capability overnight.  Once we were up in the morning and had the furnace powered, we could unplug the water pump heat and just leave the wet bay heat on.  With the generator running during breakfast, we brought the batteries up to close to full charge again.  In addition to the light bulbs, we also had our lithium battery heat powered as well.  If you want to see what that is all about, I have another mod page for that one.

Yes, it works as we hoped it would.  These were pretty easy mods to make, but change the game considerably on being able to use the motorhome when the temperature drops.  You can keep your plumbing warm while driving across areas of sub-zero tempertures, or even use the coach to camp with both types of power options.  

I mentioned earlier that I can keep an eye on the wet bay temperature.  Here is the temperature measuring kit I purchased - I mounted one probe in the propane locker to get an outside air temperature, one in the wet bay, and one near the water pump:

As you have guessed, these mods do not make you bullet proof to cold weather.  You might want to dump your tanks!  Full disclosure - your dump valves certainly do freeze up in cold weather.  (The Winnebago tank heaters do not provide enough heat to warm the water down by the valves to keep them un-frozen.)  In the spring of '21 we were lucky enough to time our dumps when the daytime highs were above zero ... but you can see another cold weather mod coming along, one day.
